My PR is adressing the following issue: 

I made sure I did the relevant tasks among:

- [ ] I detailed my objectives in an issue with the feature request or bug report
- [ ] I ran pre-commit checks and unit tests
- [ ] New lines of code are tested with relevant unit tests
- [ ] My feature is documented in the package documentation and I made sure the docs build locally
