**EcoLogits** tracks the energy consumption and environmental impacts of using generative AI models through APIs. It supports major LLM providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral AI and more (see [supported providers](tutorial/providers.md)).


## Requirements

Python 3.9+

EcoLogits relies on key libraries to provide essential functionalities:

* [Pydantic :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for data modeling.
* [Wrapt :octicons-link-external-16:](https://wrapt.readthedocs.io/) for function patching.


## Installation

To install EcoLogits, use the following command:

```shell
pip install ecologits
```

For integration with specific providers like OpenAI, additional dependencies can be installed using:

```shell
pip install ecologits[openai]
```

EcoLogits currently supports the following providers/clients:

- `anthropic`
- `cohere`
- `google-generativeai`
- `huggingface-hub` (Hugging Face Inference Endpoints)
- `litellm`
- `mistralai`
- `openai`

For detailed instructions on each provider, refer to the complete list of [supported providers and features](tutorial/providers.md). 


??? info "Installation with multiple providers"

    If you need to install extra dependencies for **multiple providers** at once, you can do so by separating them with a comma, like this:

    ```shell
    pip install ecologits[openai,anthropic]
    ```

## Usage Example

Below is a simple example demonstrating how to use the GPT-3.5-Turbo model from OpenAI with EcoLogits to track environmental impacts.

```python
from ecologits import EcoLogits
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize EcoLogits
EcoLogits.init()

client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_KEY>")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a funny joke!"}
    ]
)

# Get estimated environmental impacts of the inference
print(f"Energy consumption: {response.impacts.energy.value} kWh")
print(f"GHG emissions: {response.impacts.gwp.value} kgCO2eq")
```

Environmental impacts are quantified based on four criteria and across two phases:

Criteria:

- **Energy** (energy): Final energy consumption in kWh,
- **Global Warming Potential** (gwp): Potential impact on global warming in kgCO2eq (commonly known as GHG/carbon emissions),
- **Abiotic Depletion Potential for Elements** (adpe): Impact on the depletion of non-living resources such as minerals or metals in kgSbeq,
- **Primary Energy** (pe): Total energy consumed from primary sources in MJ.

Phases:

- **Usage** (usage): Represents the phase of energy consumption during model execution,
- **Embodied** (embodied): Encompasses resource extraction, manufacturing, and transportation phases associated with the model's lifecycle.
