# Tutorial

The :seedling: **EcoLogits** library tracks the energy consumption and environmental impacts of generative AI models accessed through APIs and their official client libraries. 

It achieves this by **patching the Python client libraries**, ensuring that each API request is wrapped with an impact calculation function. This function computes the **environmental impact based on several request features**, such as the **chosen model**, the **number of tokens generated**, and the **request's latency**. The resulting data is then encapsulated in an [`ImpactsOutput`][tracers.utils.ImpactsOutput] object, which is added to the response, containing the environmental impacts for a specific request.

## Initialization of EcoLogits

To use EcoLogits in your projects, you will need to initialize the client tracers that are used internally to intercept and enrich responses. The default initialization will use default parameters and enable tracking of all available providers. To change that behaviour, read along on how to configure EcoLogits.

```python
from ecologits import EcoLogits

# Default initialization method
EcoLogits.init()
```


### Configure providers

You can select which provider to enable with EcoLogits using the `providers` parameter.

!!! info "Default behavior is to enable all available providers."

```python title="Select a providers to enable"
from ecologits import EcoLogits

# Examples on how to enable one or multiple providers
EcoLogits.init(providers="openai")
EcoLogits.init(providers=["anthropic", "mistralai"])
```

??? warning "Disabling a provider at runtime is not supported"

    **It is currently not possible to dynamically activate and deactivate a provider at runtime.** Each time that `EcoLogits` is re-initialized with another providers, the latter will be added to the list of already initialized providers. If you think that un-initializing a provider could be necessary for your use case, please [open an issue :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/genai-impact/ecologits/issues/new/choose)."


### Configure electricity mix

You can change the [electricity mix :octicons-link-external-16:](https://ourworldindata.org/electricity-mix) for server-side computation depending on a specific location. EcoLogits will automatically change the default impact factors for electricity consumption according to the selected zone. 

Available zones are listed in the [electricity_mixes.csv :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/genai-impact/ecologits/blob/main/ecologits/data/electricity_mixes.csv) file and are based on the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 :octicons-link-external-16:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) convention with some extras like `WOR` for World or `EEE` for Europe. 

Electricity mixes for each geographic zone are sourced from the [ADEME Base EmpreinteÂ® :octicons-link-external-16:](https://base-empreinte.ademe.fr/) database and are based on yearly averages.

!!! info "Default electricity mix zone is `WOR` for World."

```python title="Select a different electricity mix"
from ecologits import EcoLogits

# Select the electricity mix of France
EcoLogits.init(electricity_mix_zone="FRA")
```
